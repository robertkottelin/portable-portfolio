## Competitive Cluster Neural Network
Unsupervised deep neural network to learn and detect liquidity patterns. The design of a competitive clustering network. Input excites certain neurons at the first layer. The outputs from these neurons are amplified and set to clusters of nodes in the second and higher layers in a hierarchy where only a single node in each cluster "fires." Further, nodes within the same cluster can be connected to other nodes in that cluster with inhibitory weights. Over successive presentations of input patterns, the network transitions to a "firing pattern" associated with each input. When new inputs are offered to the network, the hope is that the network will again exhibit the same firing patterns for inputs that are "close" to those that it has already observed.

## Environment Monitor with Controllers
Full stack software application that can monitor and manage environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and other metrics using a Raspberry Pi microcomputer and a PostgreSQL database. The application will be accessible via a web page or desktop application, using a Javascript/React user interface and an API for data exchange between the front-end and the back-end. The application will be considered a full-stack application, meaning it will include all layers of the software stack, from the database to the user interface.

## Decentralized Social Network
A decentralized social network built on the Solana blockchain with Rust and Javascript and is accessed though a web interface. The Solana blockchain serves as the backbone for the platform, and allows for secure, decentralized data storage and sharing of user data and content.
